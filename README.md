VarsitySteps - EdTech SaaS Marketplace
VarsitySteps is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between tutors and students in the Zimbabwean market. As a comprehensive EdTech marketplace, it provides a suite of tools to facilitate online learning, including real-time communication, class management, and resource sharing.

Note: This project was a solo venture developed from concept to deployment. While it is not currently live, it serves as a powerful demonstration of my full-stack development, project management, and product ownership capabilities.



About The Project
The goal of VarsitySteps was to create a centralized, all-in-one platform for online tutoring. I identified a need for a system that could handle student enrollment, class scheduling, direct communication, and resource distribution without forcing users to rely on a patchwork of different apps. I architected and built the entire platform, from the database schema and backend REST APIs to the interactive front-end user interface.

Core Features
Tutor & Student Marketplace: A public-facing marketplace for students to find and connect with qualified tutors.

Comprehensive Dashboards: Separate, intuitive dashboards for both tutors and students to manage their activities.

Class Management: Tutors can create classes, enroll students, and manage their rosters.

Real-Time Messaging: A built-in chat system, engineered with WebSockets, for seamless communication.

Video Call Integration: A "Start a Live Lesson" feature designed to integrate WebRTC for live video sessions.

File & Resource Sharing: A system for tutors to upload and share notes, assignments, and other resources with their classes.

User Authentication & Profiles: Secure user registration, login, and profile management.

Tech Stack
This project was built using a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack:

Frontend: React.js, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Real-Time Communication: WebSockets, WebRTC (planned)

Cloud & Deployment: Amazon Web Services (AWS)

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

Lessons Learned
Building VarsitySteps was an invaluable end-to-end learning experience. It solidified my skills in full-stack architecture and deployment, but more importantly, it provided deep insights into the challenges of product-market fit and the importance of a solid business model for a SaaS product's success. This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as both a developer and a product builder.
