# VarsitySteps - Tutoring Marketplace
VarsitySteps is a full-stack web application designed to bridge the gap between tutors and students in the Zimbabwean market. As a comprehensive EdTech marketplace, it provides a suite of tools to facilitate online learning, including real-time communication, class management, and resource sharing.

This project was my official attemp at being a saas entreprenuer. As with many saas projects, this one did not make the cut, however I credit that to the state of the economy in my country, **solid product**, **wrong economy**.
_**NB**_: My aws free trial ran out while I was trying to market it, so only a shell remains. 
Lessons learnt here were more about business, my coding skills were good enough, just learning new technologies here and there.

## About The Project
The goal of VarsitySteps was to create a centralized, all-in-one platform for online tutoring. I identified a need for a system that could handle student enrollment, class scheduling, direct communication, and resource distribution without forcing users to rely on a patchwork of different apps. I architected and built the entire platform, from the database schema and backend REST APIs to the interactive front-end user interface.

Core Features
**Tutor & Student Marketplace**: A public-facing marketplace for students to find and connect with qualified tutors.

**Comprehensive Dashboards**: Separate, intuitive dashboards for both tutors and students to manage their activities.

**Class Management**: Tutors can create classes, enroll students, and manage their rosters.

**Real-Time Messaging**: A built-in chat system, engineered with WebSockets, for seamless communication.

**Video Call Integration**: A "Start a Live Lesson" feature designed to integrate WebRTC for live video sessions.

**File & Resource Sharing**: A system for tutors to upload and share notes, assignments, and other resources with their classes.

**User Authentication & Profiles**: Secure user registration, login, and profile management.

**Quizzes and gamification**: I added a quiz section and gamification element with awards and badges for actions perfomed on the app, like on Reddit, overkill yes but it was a fun feature to implement.

## Tech Stack
This project was built using a modern, robust, and scalable tech stack:

Frontend: React.js, Next.js, HTML5, CSS3

Backend: Node.js, Express.js

Database: PostgreSQL

Real-Time Communication: WebSockets, WebRTC

Cloud & Deployment: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Render.io for CD/CI

Authentication: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## Lessons Learned
Building VarsitySteps was an invaluable end-to-end learning experience. It solidified my skills in full-stack architecture and deployment, but more importantly, it provided deep insights into the challenges of product-market fit and the importance of a solid business model for a SaaS product's success. This project represents a significant milestone in my journey as both a developer and a product builder.
